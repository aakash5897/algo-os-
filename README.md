# algos
few algorithms written in Python.
##USE CASE OF DIJKSTRA:
  i=Dj()
  provide the data regarding the graph like the following:
  [(vertex_1,vertex_2,weight of the edge)] example:
  ('a','b',4) which represents an edge connecting two vertices a,b(as strings) with weight 4
  [("a","b",4),("a","e",2),("a","c",1),("b","d",1),("e","d",5),("c","d",3)]
  >>> i.algo()
  source vertex:a
  destination vertex:d
  "Path:['a', 'c', 'd'],Distance:4"
